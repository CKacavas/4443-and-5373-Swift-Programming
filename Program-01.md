### First Program

1. Copy the xcode project called `Color_Game_for_Kids` from [here](https://github.com/rugbyprof/4443-and-5373-Swift-Programming/tree/master/InClassCode).
2. It should run in xcode straight away showing you something like this:

2. Chose new Xcode project using the single-view application template, and make sure you opt for Swift as the language.
3. Find an `AppDelegate.swift` file in the project hierarchy. Inside of this file find the line that says:

```swift
“// Override point for customization after application launch.”
```
